Retrospective from Candace Beverly:

During our work on the Bookshelf project I found that my strengths surround CSS and team management. While I am working diligently to become more technically proficient, my strengths involved negotiations, time management and delegation. I struggled to keep up with the pace of the project but really appreciated the steadfastness of Hugo and Taylor in respect to keeping me abreast of the project updates. I am dedicated to contributing towards team success in any way possible and look forward to collaborating with various teams in the future.
